      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>inline CSS style sheet: inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag using a style attribute with a CSS ruel to style a page element ONLY.</li>
        <li>internal CSS style sheet: contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. Ruel will apply to all tagged page elements. </li>
        <li>external CSS style sheet: keeps all the CSS rules in a seperate file which makes design choices easier.</li>
        <li>link element: used in HTML to link CSS style sheet. (used with external style sheet) </li>
        <li>rel attribute: specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.</li>
        <li>href attribute: specifies the location URL of the external resource. Uses relative patch / location derived from the current location.</li>
        <li>example: (link rel="stylesheet" href=".assets/style.css")</li>
        <li>seperation of concerns: seperating code into different files based on use. The idea that each section of code should have its own responsibility.</li>
        <li>declarations: 1. CSS property we want to apply, 2. The value of the property.</li>
        <li>margin property: indicates how much space we want around the OUTSIDE of an element.</li>
        <li>padding property: indicates how much space we want around the content INSIDE an element.</li>
        <li>CSS box model: HTML element is essentially a box. Each box consists of margins outside the element and the element's borders, padding, and content.</li>
        <li>(*) selector: (add before declaration) wild card symbol to apply the rule to all the elemnts visible on the page.</li>
        <li>do not repeat yourself (DRY): coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained.</li>
        <li>text-align positioning property: way to center a title or header.</li>
        <li>block value: assigns each image to start on a new line.</li>
        <li>selector: defines the element or attributes to which the rules or declaractions will apply.</li>
        <li>class attribute: allows us to share a css rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector.</li>
        <li>. preceding "classs" designates this as a class selector. ex. .card - HTML assigned to the class card will gain these properties from CSS. </li>
        <li>example: (from HTML) (section class="card")</li>

      <h2>Git</h2>
      <ul>

        <li>git checkout -b "branch-name": creates a new branch and switches to it.</li>
        <li>  (checkout): command is to move the working branch to a new branch.</li>
        <li>  (-b): flag creates a new branch.</li>

        <li><b>Steps to save our work to GitHub:</b></li>
        <li>git add -A: add the changed files in our working directory to the staging area of Git. (stage changes).</li>
        <li>  (add): flag adds modifications in the current working brank to the staging area.</li>
        <li>  (-A): flag indicates that we want to add all changes.</li>
        <li>git commit -m "description of change": once changes are staged, we can commit them to our repository. Once completed, our Git Repository is now up to date with our directory.</li>
        <li>  (-m): flag used to associate a message with our commit. Short descriptive messages of change implemented.</li>
        <li>git pull origin main: pull the latest "main" branch. / make sure branch is up-to-date. *do before pushing code making sure branch is up to date*.</li>
        <li>  (pull): command to receive a branch's modicfaction into the local environemnt.</li>
        <li>  (origin): keyword indicates the branch. ex. main.</li>
        <li>  (main): indicates the branch. main is from GitHub repo.</li>
        <li>git push origin "name-of-branch": push up all of our changes.</li>
        <li>  (push): command 1. you can create a new remote branch. 2. add new changes to an existing branch.</li>

      <h2>Javascript</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>variable: (keyword: var) a named container that allows us to store data in oure code.</li>
        <li>(=) assignment operator: assigns specific data that we want stored in our variable.</li>
        <li>ex. var "name" = "data stored" </li>
        <li>string: includes more than 1 stored data. *CONTAINED IN ("quotation marks")*</li>
        <li>(;) : every Javascript line of code ends in a (;)</li>
        <li>console.log (method to the file): used to output a message to the web console by adding an ARGUMENT.</li>
        <li>console (console.log): refers to the test environment that developers use to check out their code.</li>
        <li>.log() (console.log): is a *METHOD* / set of instructions that can be executed by a computer. Will output what is added in the parentheses to the console.</li>
        <li>(script src="./assets/script.js/file_location")(/script): used to link script.js file to index.html file. (linked with BODY ELEMENT)</li>
        <li>control flow: is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. Javascript code runs from first statement down to the last statement.</li>
        <li>(if) conditional statement: code will only execute IF the statement meets a condition or is true.</li>
        <li>(else if) conditional statement: adds more than 1 condition on top of (if) statement.</li>
        <li>Boolean: logical data type that can have only the values true or false.</li>
        <li>truthy: (value that is true) the if statement will do whatever action we ask it to do in between the curly brackets.</li>
        <li>falsy: (value that is not true) the computer will ignore whatever is in between the curly brackets.</li>
        <li>ex. falsy values: 0, -0, On, "", null, undefined, NaN, fales.</li>
        <li>conditional statements and loops: control the order in which code is executed or if it is een executed at all.</li>
        <li>(===) strict equality operator: checks to see if two values are equal and returns a Boolean result true if they are equal and false if they are not.</li>
        <li>array: a single variable that is used to hold a group of data (usually related data).</li>
        <li>index: a number which identifies the data in the array. (starts with 0)</li>
        <li>(for) loops: uses the predictable patter of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a signle code block to be executed over and over.</li>
        <li>statement: the starting point of the loop. - ex. var x = 0; </li>
        <li>condition: the second statement - ex. x < name.length;</li>
        <li>final statement: allows the array to iterate over each item. - ex. x++ or x+1</li>
        <li>comment out code: makes code inactive without deleting it incase you need it later. Use (/* before) and (*/ after) a block of code.</li>
        <li>function: a set of instructions that tells a computer how to perform a task. (does not automatically execute - only when we call it / reusuable code)</li>
        <li>"()": a functions name is followed by a parentheses ex. function helloWorld()</li>
        <li>"{}": code to be executed is written inside curly brackets.</li>
        <li>randomize a selection: use math function to select random number. ex. Math.random()</li>
