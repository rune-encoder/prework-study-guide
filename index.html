      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>inline CSS style sheet: inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag using a style attribute with a CSS ruel to style a page element ONLY.</li>
        <li>internal CSS style sheet: contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. Ruel will apply to all tagged page elements. </li>
        <li>external CSS style sheet: keeps all the CSS rules in a seperate file which makes design choices easier.</li>
        <li>link element: used in HTML to link CSS style sheet. (used with external style sheet) </li>
        <li>rel attribute: specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.</li>
        <li>href attribute: specifies the location URL of the external resource. Uses relative patch / location derived from the current location.</li>
        <li>example: (link rel="stylesheet" href=".assets/style.css")</li>
        <li>seperation of concerns: seperating code into different files based on use. The idea that each section of code should have its own responsibility.</li>
        <li>declarations: 1. CSS property we want to apply, 2. The value of the property.</li>
        <li>margin property: indicates how much space we want around the OUTSIDE of an element.</li>
        <li>padding property: indicates how much space we want around the content INSIDE an element.</li>
        <li>CSS box model: HTML element is essentially a box. Each box consists of margins outside the element and the element's borders, padding, and content.</li>
        <li>(*) selector: (add before declaration) wild card symbol to apply the rule to all the elemnts visible on the page.</li>
        <li>do not repeat yourself (DRY): coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained.</li>
        <li>text-align positioning property: way to center a title or header.</li>
        <li>block value: assigns each image to start on a new line.</li>
        <li>selector: defines the element or attributes to which the rules or declaractions will apply.</li>
        <li>class attribute: allows us to share a css rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector.</li>
        <li>. preceding "classs" designates this as a class selector. ex. .card - HTML assigned to the class card will gain these properties from CSS. </li>
        <li>example: (from HTML) (section class="card")</li>
