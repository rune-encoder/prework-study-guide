# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Need help studying code before class begins? This webpage was made for just that. 
It was intended to be an interactive way to keep notes and retain infomation about code for a student learning code.

While writing notes on a note pad or on the computer may be handy it was not enough to help me retain information. 

This was the reason we began developing this webpage. 
To practice code and make notes at the same time! Making learning more efficient!
